_Globalism has given China the power to silence American citizens. This threatens the fabric of our democracy._

How do democracies die? Slowly, while watching basketball.

On October 4th, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image with the text: "Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong," and the worlds of basketball and geopolitics collided. The American public is largely critical of the NBA's response, a [series](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1181007488856072192) of [statements](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/10/08/adam-silver-statement-china-nba) that seem inconsistent with the progressive, pro-speech reputation that the league has built for itself in recent years. Others, including Vice President Mike Pence, have [criticized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBNB-PvakqY) corporations for their willingness to discard American values and ignore human rights abuses in order to profit in places like China.

A popular fear is that the dark future of capitalism features American corporations turning a blind eye to authoritarianism but the fallout from Morey's tweet portends something darker – that global capitalism threatens to kill our system of democracy in the United States.

Consistent with Pence’s comments, there’s a way to read the NBA’s initial statement as an American company cowering to China and abandoning its duty to promote democratic values abroad. Viewed this way, multi-national companies are tools of foreign policy and their economic value on the global marketplace can be used as leverage to influence foreign governments.

This is partially true; trade gives policymakers the tool of economic sanctions, which can be used to punish bad actors. Where this view goes wrong is in its expectation of employees of multi-national companies to speak out on behalf of their government’s foreign policy goals. It’s for the best that we aren’t looking to the CEO of Starbucks to condemn the Turkish attack on the Kurds (Starbucks operates over 450 stores in Turkey).

In tandem with diplomacy, the strength of our own democracy has [proven](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/25/why-is-america-so-bad-at-promoting-democracy-in-other-countries/) to be our best tool for promoting democratic values abroad. Its public voice given to domestic issues that best serves our foreign policy interests rather than public voice given to international affairs. LeBron James’ [“I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt](https://time.com/3624684/lebron-james-i-cant-breathe-eric-garner/) goes further to bring about a democratic China than [whatever he could possibly say about the protests in Hong Kong](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/15/lebron-james-criticizes-daryl-moreys-decision-send-controversial-hong-kong-tweet/).

The future we should fear is one where China recognizes this, and uses their economic might to squeeze politics out of business. The Morey tweet incident provides a blueprint for how this might work. After LeBron James’ disaster of a press conference, in which he called Morey “uneducated,” and the resulting backlash aimed at James, the NBA community has gone radio silent on the matter.

Whether by directive or collective choice, it’s been decided that the costs of speaking on China are too high. What happens when the costs of speaking out are too high on domestic issues? What happens when we lose the role of voice in our own country?

With increased economic integration, we’ve given China a tool to weaken our democracy. Dani Rodrick, an economist and professor at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, [theorizes](https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/06/the-inescapable.html) that the nation state, hyper-globalization, and democracy are “mutually incompatible: we can combine any two of the three, but never have all three simultaneously and in full.” A country looking to gain from trade must give up either some of its sovereignty as a nation or its freedom to operate as a democracy. The Morey tweet incident shows us that a choice is being made and its democracy that stands to lose.

What can be done?

Companies need to back each other on free speech. The risk of losing access to the Chinese market plays directly into US competition. Through a collective commitment to protect democratic values, American companies can weaken China’s power. There’s no direct substitute for the NBA but a coalition of media and entertainment firms who also serve the Chinese market can lend their support to the NBA.

Policymakers have to be willing to pull back on global trade, particularly with China, who unlike other countries (save, possibly, for the EU) has the economic might to influence American behavior. A trade war may be unwise but allowing a foreign power to weaken our democracy is more irresponsible.

Lastly, American citizens have a role to play in defending democracy, and it’s not as simple as “buying American.” We must fight to keep politics in business because our voices are too important to democracy to allow ourselves to be censored.

The next cold war won’t be waged on the basketball court but, frankly, the idea isn’t far off. Globalism’s trade-offs have been made apparent and defending our values at home should supersede promoting them abroad.
