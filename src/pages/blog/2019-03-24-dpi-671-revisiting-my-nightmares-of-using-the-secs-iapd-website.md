As soon as I saw the question, I thought of the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website (IAPD)](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/). What is undoubtedly an esoteric site for most people on Earth was, for the better part of five years, my most frequently visited web domain.

In my former life, I was a manager of business strategy for the IA (Investment Advisor) sales division at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. What this means in English is that I was responsible for studying the landscape for a particular type of financial advisor and using what I could find to justify strategic decisions for a sales team that wanted these advisors to buy J.P. Morgan products. A big part of my research revolved around the IAPD website. This is because [Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ria.asp), the types of clients my team sold to, were required to file details about their firm, including the amount of client assets they managed, with the SEC in a document called a [Form ADV](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersformadvhtm.html).  The IAPD website is, in essence, a database for RIAs via their Form ADVs.

Now, on to the problems. To spare you my extensive list of problems with IAPD, I will focus only on what was my most common workflow: finding a firm’s assets under management (AUM). I would need to do this several times a day in order to either verify information in the internal J.P. Morgan systems or prioritize new sales targets. 

My expectations were simple: I should be able to look up a firm, “Summit Trail Advisors” for example, and quickly find out what their AUM is. And while that’s the relevant piece of information to me, I would expect that a website built for “public disclosure” would make most of its information easy to grab.

When you type something like “Summit Trail” into the website’s search box (after clicking ‘firm’ to indicate that you want to search for a firm instead of an individual) and hit ‘enter,’ it feels like you’re bound to either see a ton of results or none. The search function on the website attempts to be smart so it includes alternate or former firm names in your search. At the same time, it will catch minor misspellings. The real problems lie when you get to the results page, which looks like this.

If you’re lucky enough to get a short list of results like this, you’re still at least three clicks away from figuring out the AUM. This is because clicking on your target result first brings you to a registration status page where you can then click into an online version of the Form ADV. For reference, below is what it finally looks like when you find AUM.

To me, it seems like this information could easily be formatted in a spreadsheet or an interactive database but, instead, I had to use an online version of a paper form. You can’t download a list of results or data points. You can’t run an advanced search that filters on information stored in the Form ADV. All of this data is just sitting in hard to navigate electronic forms. 

This meant I spent countless hours traversing the search function of IAPD. I’d have to google elsewhere to validate alternate names or spellings of firms that I knew existed in real life. Those clicks are hardcoded to my brain now after having navigated from a firm’s reporting history to its AUM thousands of times (perhaps, tens of thousands).

The SEC’s unwillingness to make this data easy-to-access supported a cottage industry of data companies that presumably ran scripts to download this public information. To say IAPD made me think less of the SEC is an understatement. My assessment has always been that if their “public disclosure” systems are this bad, there’s no way their internal systems - which the entire industry relies on for regulatory matters - are satisfactory. 

The poor experience that I have using IAPD makes me think the SEC is failing to do it’s job well. I don’t think IAPD is a priority for them, but that only adds to my argument that they’re failing the public. I was a power user; I wanted IAPD to be better so that I could be better at my job, which inevitably meant making J.P. Morgan more money. I could only imagine the frustrations that a regular person would have, in an effort to do their due diligence on their financial advisor. 

I think the SEC doesn’t prioritize improving IAPD because the standard that they have set for themselves is disclosure, in name only. I think they’re checking the box on whether or not they have made the information publicly available and could care less whether or not some person or J.P. Morgan or even a member of the general public can easily find what they are looking for. One day I hope they raise this standard with the understanding that publicly available data in a useless portal is next to useless to the general public. It’s only useful enough to cause headaches for power user like me.
