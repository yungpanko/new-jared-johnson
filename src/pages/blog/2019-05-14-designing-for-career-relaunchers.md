As part of the [_Design Survivor: Design for Desirability_](https://www.desirabilitylab.com/portfolio/design-survivor/) course at Harvard, I co-designed a service for people looking to relaunch their careers. Mom Tinder is a matching platform that helps mostly college-educated women, who have left the workforce to care for children, build stronger networks that earn them career opportunities.

<br>

This project started with the analysis of a large data set on career relaunches pulled together by our class as a whole. My team focused in on the disparity between the percentage of respondents (35%) that cited their network as a key element in helping them find a new job and the numbers often cited in broad studies (70-85%). We formed a hypothesis that people's networks suffer when they leave the workforce and if we were able to help them build and maintain stronger networks during this time, we could help them in their eventual re-entry to the workforce.

Mom Tinder integrates information from LinkedIn and Facebook to connect with parents with common skills, similar career interests, and shared hobbies. The platform uses AI to suggest manageable meetups at local events and convenient times.

<br>

We also believe that many parents spend time with other parents that they donâ€™t enjoy having conversations with just because of their kids. Why not combine building powerful relationships and entertainment for your kids?
