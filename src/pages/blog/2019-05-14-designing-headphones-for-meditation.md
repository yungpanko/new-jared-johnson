As part of the [_Design Survivor: Design for Desirability_](https://www.desirabilitylab.com/portfolio/design-survivor/) course at Harvard, I learned how to design my own headphones using CAD software. The design was inspired by the meditation app Headspace. I wanted to design a set of large clamshell-like headphones that completely cover the user’s ear to block out any annoying sounds nearby. Using a special set of headphones will help the user ritualize their meditation and extract deeper value from their practice. I didn’t get around to 3D printing my design but the clamshell that I created in TinkerCAD can house the 3D printed speaker from Thingiverse and can attach to the headband from Thingiverse as well.

For challenge 4, I decided to learn how to design my own headphones using CAD software. The design of my headphones was inspired by the meditation app [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). I used a large clamshell-like shape that completely covers the user’s ear. This is intended to block out any annoying sounds nearby. Using a special set of headphones will help the user ritualize their meditation and extract deeper value from their practice. I didn’t get around to 3D printing my design but the clamshell that I created in [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) can house a 3D printed speaker from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31392) and can attach to a headband available from Thingiverse as well.
