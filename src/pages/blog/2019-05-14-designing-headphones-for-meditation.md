For challenge 4, I decided to learn how to design my own headphones using CAD software. The design of my headphones was inspired by the meditation app Headspace. I wanted to design a set of large clamshell-like headphones that completely cover the user’s ear to block out any annoying sounds nearby. Using a special set of headphones will help the user ritualize their meditation and extract deeper value from their practice. I didn’t get around to 3D printing my design but the clamshell that I created in TinkerCAD can house the 3D printed speaker from Thingiverse and can attach to the headband from Thingiverse as well.
