## 1. drake - god’s plan

i teared up in a staircase when i saw this for the first time. rappers give money away all the time but the narrative of giving away your labels budget adds a robin hood-esque twist. drake is the socialist hero we deserve.

## 2. j. cole - kevin's heart

i thought this video was smart and well executed. kevin hart does a lot and although i can't recall ever seeing a kevin hart movie, i think he's now underrated as a comedic figure.

## 3. tierra whack - whack world

everytime i start to assume that everyone's seen this video, i go to look at the view count and react™️. this is one of most interesting releases in the era of the short album.

## 4. future - feds did a sweep

drake had an instagram post recently with the caption, "a crime family but a family nonetheless." that's the idea of this music video. yeah, it's been done before but show me where it's been done better than this.

## 5. mura masa ft. octavian - move me

mura masa's videos are always so cinematic. i don't know if i was hip to octavian when this dropped but either way this video had me so excited to see and hear more from him.

## 6. a$ap rocky and tyler, the creator - potato salad

the days when new AWGE DVDs release have to be the most annoying days for my instagram followers. i have a deep need to post all of my favorite segments from the freestyles. this rocky and tyler video though? i could hardly contain myself enough to grab my phone. the monica beat. the eiffel tower as a backdrop. the chains. JADEN SMITH!
