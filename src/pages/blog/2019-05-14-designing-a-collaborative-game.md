As part of the [_Design Survivor: Design for Desirability_](https://www.desirabilitylab.com/portfolio/design-survivor/) course at Harvard, I co-designed a game. Bank Heist is a collaborative game for mobile where communication is required to advance through a series of challenges. Players have disparate information and will need to quickly communicate back and forth in order to solve each challenge.

<br>

We took inspiration from the VR game, [_Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_](https://keeptalkinggame.com/). In that game, one person, wearing a VR headset, is tasked with diffusing a bomb but the instructions to do so are only available to the other game players in the room via a computer screen. In order to be successful, all of the players must collaborative effectively, listening closely to the instructions being passed back and forth.
